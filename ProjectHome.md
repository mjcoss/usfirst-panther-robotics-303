Project will contain software that can be used and shared by students participating in the US FIRST FRC competitions.

Code will be developed for Java, C++, and Labview, with the hope that we can integrate into each of the IDEs being used.

In addition, we will be working on functional libraries and classes to help expand the capabilities of teams.
